## Ever had trouble trying to calculate the chances of all the craziness going on in your DND campaigns? 
Well, that's perfectly normal. There are likely dozens on dozens of dice being rolled every single session, and the normal human brain isn't great at computing those types of calculations while a ton of other things are going on at once. 

Let that be a problem of the past, however, with the DND Statstics Site! 
Using statistical concepts I learned from my CS department's mandatory statistics class, I incorperated them in a website that is accessible and easy to use. 

Here's a little demo to show you how the webiste looks, in motion:

Make sure to hold left shift when left clicking on an event to select that event (makes the bold outline appear)
